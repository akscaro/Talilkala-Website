		<h1>Materials and Procedures</h1><a name="george"></a>
<b> Materials:
<br>
<br>
                <i>1 pc of gardening trowel<br>
                9 pcs of pots<br>
                36 liters of loam soil<br>
                1 pc of pruner<br>
                42 ml of low nitrogen vegetable compost<br>
                45 seeds of tomato<br>
                1 pc of notebook and pen<br>
                5 gallons of water<br>
                1 pc weighing scale<br>
<h2>Procedures</h2><a name="george"></a>
<b>Producing:<br>
<br>
1.) Prepare all the materials such as; pots, carrots, cucumber, and radish.<br>
<br>2.) Layer them ; a layer of soil, a thin layer of carrots, another layer of soil, a thin layer of cucumber, another
layer of soil, a thin layer of radish and lastly, anothe layer of soil.<br>
<br>3.) Moisten the soil with at least 2 cups of water. We should make sure that the water saturates each layer all
the way to the bottom of the pot.<br>
<br>4.) Place it in a sunny location.<br>
<br>5.) Once a week, we should observe the roma tomato plants. If the soil begins to dry, add water to moisten.
<br>
<br>		
<br><b>Preparing:<br>
<br>
1. First, gather all the materials needed for the experiment: buy 45 seeds of roma tomatoes, 9 pieces
of 8 inches pots, 600 ml water, 1 gardening shovel, 42 ml of low nitrogen vegetable compost, 1
piece ruler, 36 liters of garden soil, 5 gallons of water, 1 notebook and pen.<br>
<br>2. Second, puncture holes underneath all 9 pots<br>
<br>3. Next,  label the 3  pots “A1, A2 and A3” and label the next 3 pots “B1, B2 and B3” and label the
last three pots as C1, C2, C3. Every set-up must have 3 replicates each. Remember that there must
all be 9 replicates. Put 6 replicates on the 2 experimental set-up (3 each) and 3 on controlled set-
up so 9 pots will be used for this experiment.<br>
<br>4. Then, put 4 liters of garden soil for each pot.<br>
<br>5. Wait for 5 to 10 days for the Roma tomato seeds to germinate. After 5 to 10 days, soak the tomato seeds in
the water overnight before planting them. The next day, plant 5 tomato seeds for each pot. Since there are 9
pots, 45 seeds will be used for this experiment.<br>
<br>6. For pot A1, A2 and A3  dig an inch and put 14 ml of low-nitrogen vegetable compost each, and
for Pot B1, B2 and B3, dig an inch and put 7 ml of low-nitrogen vegetable compost each.<br>
<br>7. Lastly, place all pots in a position where all can get full sunlight and water all pots with 200 ml of water
each.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Making Observations about the compost:<br>
<br>1.) Once a week, we should observe and check or track the composting level.<br>
<br>2.) Check if the layers have compacted slightly and add water.<br>
<br>3.) After 3 weeks, examine the compost. It shall be ready to use when it crumbles in your hand and it has dark
brown or black color.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Maitenance:<br>
<br>1.) First, water all pots with 200 ml of water each 1 time every day.<br>
<br>2.) Next, put 21 and 10.5 ml of low nitrogen vegetable compost every 3 weeks.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Making Observations about the plants:<br>
<br>1.) First, use a ruler to know if the height of the tomato with 21 ml of low nitrogen vegetable compost
has grown better than the height of the roma tomatoeswith only 10.5 ml of the compost or if vice
versa. Data should be gathered once a week for at least 8 weeks.<br>
<br>2.) Second, check the height of the plant and how many centimeters it has grown and compare.<br>
<br>3.) Lastly, record it in a notebook and always remember to gather data twice a week for at least 8 weeks.
