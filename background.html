		<h1 id="about">Problem</h1> 
		<p id="mainpar">Talikala is a non-governmental organization (NGO) run by women for women which offers support, advice, training, and counseling to women and girls who have been forced into the sex trade in Davao City, Philippines. The organization also promotes human rights by raising awareness on the rights of women and children and on issues such as reproductive health, gender sensitivity, anti-prostitution anti-trafficking in persons, online sexual abuse and exploitation, and capacity building of leaders of community-based organizations. Founded on August 7, 1987 by three women of diverse backgrounds: American lay missionary Cindy O'Donnell, Filipina social worker Elizabeth O'Brien, and former night club dancer Felicidad Prieto, the group was formed to help protect the prostituted women and children in Davao City from the crisis wreaked by HIV/AIDS, but it has since grown able to respond to the challenge of totally emancipating these exploited women and children from the bondage of human trafficking and prostitution. Its beneficiaries are women who were victims of prostitution and sex trafficking, aged from 6-50 years old, and its benefactors are organizations that Talikala has helped by providing essential technical support until these groups themselves became independent and fully self-supporting. One of these groups is Men in Valuable Partnership with Women and Children (MVP) which started as a grassroots and community-based organization of men that provides perspectives about prostitution from its demand side.</p>
		
		<h2>Project Summary </h2><a name="dance"></a>
		<img src="img1.png"/>		
		<p class="subpar">This project was made to support Talikala more with their advocacy and to address the problem that they are facing. One of the problems that are affecting Talikala the most is the scarcity of consistent sponsors, especially since Talikala is a non-governmental organization meaning it is not supported by the government and is fully voluntary. They are going to need consistent funding in order to implement their different activities and programs. 
        The main objective of the project in the long term is to address the problems of our partner institution in terms of sponsors, funding, and donations. This might help Talikala in addressing the scarcity that they are experiencing. The total budget that will be allotted to this project is Php 2500.With the project, we are hoping that we can address the pressing issue that Talikala is facing. Their issue of the lack of sponsors, volunteers, and donations to fulfill their mission through the constant hosting of events such as social media forums, meetings with politicians, and more will be addressed already.Moreover, awareness of Talikala’s cause will be widely spread through different communities of an estimated 100 people or residents, especially in the slum areas/barangay where it is said that prostitution is rampant due to poverty. 
        <br/>
		<h2>Intervention</h2><a name="game"></a>
		<img src="Talikala.jpg"/>
		<p class="subpar"> Project Anti-Prostitution; In Line with Talikala Inc. is highly significant as it addresses the occurring community problem in relation to our partner institution, Talikala Inc., which is the scarcity of consistent funding, donations, and sponsors to run their activities so that they can fulfill their missions. Considering that Talikala is a non-governmental organization, it is always one of its priorities to have consistent funding, donations, and sponsors. PAPILTI ensures that Talikala will receive funds, donors, and more sponsors through our proposed business which is a clothing line that aims to raise at least P15,000 to donate to Talikala. Moreover, another one of PAPILTI’s goals is to create a website that contains information about Talikala’s mission and vision, their contact details, the aim and purpose of PAPILTI.

		<h2><b>Significance</h2></b>
		<p class = "subpar"> Papilti helps prostituted women regain their dignity and role of society, putting emphasis on why prostituted women are victims, and why taking action in addressing these issues is so important. Lastly, PAPILTI also aims to go viral or create trends in social media platforms such as Tiktok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to further promote our cause. Therefore, with all the initiatives taken to fulfill our common mission, we hope to see successful outcomes as a result of our efforts.
